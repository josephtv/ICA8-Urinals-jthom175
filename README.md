# ICA8-Urinals-jthom175

How many urinals are free? 
In men's public toilets with urinals, there is this unwritten rule that you leave at least one urinal free between you and 
the next person peeing. For example, if there are 3 urinals and one person is already peeing in the left one, you will 
choose the urinal on the right and not the one in the middle. That means that a maximum of 3 people can pee at the 
same time on public toilets with 5 urinals when following this rule (Only 2 if the first-person pees into urinal 2 or 4).

Examples 
10001 returns 1 (10101) 
1001 returns 0 (1001) 
00000 returns 3 (10101) 
0000 returns 2 (1001) 
01000 returns 1 (01010 or 01001)  
011 returns -1 

#Notes
If the user is inputting an invalid text, for example "abc", this program returns -1
